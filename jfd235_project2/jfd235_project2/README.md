To train the HMMs, run the cell underneath "Build HMM for Each Gesture", replacing the value in "data_dir" with your target directory of IMU data.

To evaluate a gesture with the trained models, run the cell underneath "Evaluate Unknown Gesture", changing "data_dir" and "filename" to point to the gesture IMU data being tested.
